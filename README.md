# Shopping Cart Project

To practice ReactJS and implement BrowserRoutes to navigate multiple pages

## Thoughts

Super happy with this one. Currently, I have managed to work out the routing as well as creating all functional components and their states with my own research and referring to my past projects only. Definitely a huge improvement from  last time. The cart is working behind the scenes and all that is left is to present the information on the Cart page.
